  Using point based simple grading

    And I press "Save and display"

  Scenario: Test setting up forum grading and test some of the basic functionality.
    # Open the grader interface.
    Given I click on "Grade users" "button"
    And I should see "Grading (Point Forum)"
    # Navigate between users.
    When I click on "Save changes and proceed to the next user" "button"
    Then I should see "Student 1"
    # Set and confirm the input.
    And I set the field "grade" to "6"
    And the field "grade" matches value "6"
    # Save the grade & Check it shows on user navigation
    And I click on "Save" "button"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the next user" "button"
    And I should see "Student 2"
    And the field "grade" does not match value "6"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the previous user" "button"
    And I should see "Student 1"
    And the field "grade" matches value "6"
    # Confirm the grade is now in the grading report.
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I navigate to "View > User report" in the course gradebook
    And I click on "Student 1" in the "user" search widget
    And the following should exist in the "user-grade" table:
      | Grade item              | Calculated weight | Grade | Range | Percentage | Contribution to course total |
      | Point Forum whole forum | 100.00 %          | 6.00  | 0–10  | 60.00 %    | 60.00 %                      |
      | Course total            | -                 | 6.00  | 0–10  | 60.00 %    | -                            |
