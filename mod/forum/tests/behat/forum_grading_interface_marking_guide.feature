    # Open the grader interface.
    And I click on "Grade users" "button"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the next user" "button"
    And I wait until "Student 1" "text" exists
    # Xpaths used to get around the name needing to be a very specific dynamic name.
    And I set the field with xpath "//input[contains(@aria-label,'Guide criterion A score')]" to "25"
    And I set the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Additional comments for criterion, Guide criterion A')]" to "Very good"
    And I set the field with xpath "//input[contains(@aria-label,'Guide criterion B score')]" to "20"
    And I set the field with xpath "//input[contains(@aria-label,'Guide criterion C score')]" to "35"
    And I set the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Additional comments for criterion, Guide criterion C')]" to "Nice!"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the previous user" "button"
    And the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Additional comments for criterion, Guide criterion A')]" does not match value "Very good"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the next user" "button"
    And I wait until "Student 1" "text" exists
    And the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Additional comments for criterion, Guide criterion A')]" matches value "Very good"
    # Confirm the grade is now in the grading report.
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
